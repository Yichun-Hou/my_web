<h1>GDP components over time and among countries</h1>
<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a> and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised.</p>

<p>We reproduced the two charts given above the images.</p>
<p>We can see from the chart above that whereas Germany and the United States have a relatively similar make-up of their GDP, India stands out in that the composition of the GDP has changed the most. Household expenditure as a % of GDP has decreased significantly in India; gross capital formation has instead taken up a greater proportion, showing that the government has invested domestically (in infrastructure/assets/PPE etc.) far more, in relative terms, since 2000.</p>
<p>For Germany, we can see that net exports has increased as a % of GDP since 2000, which is likely attributable to increased exports within key industries (e.g. automobile, with expansions into global markets). It is also interesting that we can see dips in the plotted lines within the time frame of the Global Financial Crisis in 2007-2008.</p>
<p>The United States is the only country within this set to have a consistent increase in household expenditure as a % of GDP, whereas government expenditure has been decreasing substantially relative to the other components. The final graph is especially interesting when compared to the GDP graph in absolute terms. Measured in billion dollars, the increase in household expenditure, i.e. consumption, appears massive, yet the final graph puts this into perspective by showing that the proporiton of this component increased by around 10%.</p>
